## OBJECTIVE
Sub Objective 1:
* Our project aims at developing real-time surveillance with early warning intelligence on harmful gases, temperature, humidity which Minimize Health Risks of Workers Within Mining Industry.

 Sub Objective 2 :
* All these parameters are detected continuously by temperature sensor, carbon monoxide, gas sensor, humidity sensor and if they cross the pre-defined limit, then the user gets alert as the buzzer will automatically turn on with LED indications. Our project involves implementation of Wi-Fi module and add-on of heartbeat sensor to monitor the health of workers.

|Sensors|Connections|
|----|-----|
|DHT11|In this system works on Radio Frequency which has two parts Transmitter and Receiver. In the Transmitting part we have all the sensor attached such as DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity sensing|
|MQ135|MQ135 gas sensor has high sensitivity to Ammonia, Sulfide and Benze steam. It is with low cost and particularly suitable for Air quality monitoring application. MQ135 sensor connection is established on Transmitting part|
|MQ 2|MQ2 Gas Sensor Module is a robust Gas sensor suitable for sensing LPG, Smoke, Carbon Monoxide concentrations in the air. All these parameter are detected continuously by sensors and if they crosses predefined limit then user get alert as a buzzer automatically turn on with LED indications.|

## Usage

```python

```
